# LetsDefend-SOC-Practice-Writeups
Welcome to my repository, where I showcase detailed write-ups of solutions to tickets from the LetsDefend Practice Labs.

## Go on LetsDefend yourself and start practicing!
LetsDefend Practice Labs immerse participants in realistic cybersecurity scenarios, replicating the challenges SOC analysts face daily. Through hands-on exercises, these labs hone the skills necessary for detecting, analyzing, and mitigating real-world security incidents. If you want to start practicing click the link to follow along my journey: https://app.letsdefend.io/homepage

## What type of problems will I be encountering in LetsDefend's practice labs?
The LetsDefend Practice Labs present a variety of cybersecurity challenges that mirror the real-world responsibilities of SOC analysts. A few of these examples include:
- Analyzing logs for malicious activity like brute force attacks or suspicious login attempts.
- Investigating alerts triggered by suspicious network traffic, like command-and-control (C2) communication or data exfiltration.
- Analyzing file hashes to identify known malicious software.
- Inspecting suspected malicious files in a sandbox environment to observe the behavior.
- Responding to a ransomware attack or phishing email by isolating affected systems.
- Investigating suspected phishing emails to confirm malicious intent.
- and many more.

## What to expect from these write ups
Each write-up provides my step-by-step approach and analysis for resolving security tickets selected from LetsDefendâ€™s Practice Lab. These documents are designed to:
- Demonstrate practical problem-solving in handling cybersecurity incidents.
- Share insights into responding to real-world challenges faced in a business environment.
- Serve as a resource for others aiming to strengthen their incident response and SOC skills. 

## Small Roadmap
A few things I would like to implement over time:
- Analyze malicious pcap files from https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/training-exercises.html using Wireshark and create writeups for those too
- Create youtube videos that go over some of the practice labs to reach to a wider audience
